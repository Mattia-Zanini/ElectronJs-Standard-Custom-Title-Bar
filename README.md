# ElectronJs-Standard-Custom-Title-Bar
this is an application made with electron, with a custom title bar, and that you can customize to your liking, this is a version that I consider standard. There is also a custom scroll bar that can be changed or removed

This app was copied and modified (because the buttons, at least to me, didn't work) from this [repository](https://github.com/binaryfunt/electron-seamless-titlebar-tutorial)
